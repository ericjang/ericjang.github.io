Hello! I am a research scientist on the Robotics team at Google.

The last few years of Machine Learning research have shown that rich data combined with simple statistical learning algorithms and powerful computational resources can outperform hand-engineered systems in computer vision, translation, and speech recognition problems. 

My research focuses on answering whether that principle -- big data and small algorithms -- can yield unprecedented capabilities in the domain of robotics, just like the computer vision, translation, and speech revolutions before it. Specifically, I focus on robotic manipulation and self-supervised robotic learning. 

My other interests include neuroscience, biomimicry, computer graphics, and financial markets.
