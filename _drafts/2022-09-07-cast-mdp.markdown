offline RL you write some logs for one MDP, then you want to convert them into logs for another mdp


discrete action -> go down, close gripper, go back up

in the above example, separation between agent and environment is the boundary between the discrete action being translated into real world robot behavior

so given some program trace and log of computational events, you want to do "data surgery" where you "move" this boundary.
