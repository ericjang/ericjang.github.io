Some questions I came up with:



# Research

what's a research result, not necessarily from your own line of research, that is surprising or counter-intuitive to you? why?

take your research idea - how would you scale this up to a household robot system? what intermediate pieces do you need to de-risk?

explain this paper to me as if I were going to implement it 


# Research Engineering Design

design a better alternative to Tensorboard. What motivates this?

design a workflow manager for batch RL. what use cases does it support / not support

Design a mobile experiment manager. what features do you support/not support.
