summary: I wrote a book!
---

I've been working on a book for the last 

You can buy the book here: [[paperback]]() [[kindle]](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1WRN9VR)

... but most of all because I am sick and tired of editing it so it's time to ship it.





I'm happy to send you a free paperback as long as you share a tweet about the book. DM me on Twitter if you're interested in this. I'll prioritize people with wider audiences first. While supplies last.



but I've also been pouring the bulk of of my blog-writing energy for the last 4 years into a long form book! 




Want to hear my cynical takes on both Effective Altruists and AI Ethicists alike ?
