## What did you want to start your company on?


There is a product I've wanted to build for some time, which is a combined data management + labeling + active learning software for building human-in-the-loop AGI. It's not unlike what Tesla has built in their AutoPilot team for surfacing hard negatives, but generalized far beyond autonomous cars. I think such a system will be foundational to scaling up machine learning to millions of tasks. This applies universally to robotics as well as digital agents, such as [world of bits](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shi17a/shi17a.pdf) or [conversational assistants](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/). 

I initially thought that I would start an company in the MLOps space to help all these companies with this "next generation data labeling tool". Lots of well-meaning people tell me that data labeling is an already-captured market, but I have conviction on the following:

- The economic pie for data management + labeling will become much, much bigger than what it is today. 
- The future of data tooling will look nothing like the current workflows (Nucleus, Aquarium, etc.)
- As someone who worked at the cutting edge of research, I have some unique insights on how Software 2.0 should be designed.

Seems like the textbook reasons for starting a new company, no? But then I talked to a bunch of potential customers & employers to understand their ML and data labeling needs, and quickly learned that there are three types of enterprise customers:

- **(2012 Customers)** This is the vast majority of companies. The customer has no need for such an advanced data management capability. What they need is way simpler infrastructure that's 5-10 years behind cutting edge technology, and may not even need machine learning at all.
- **(2022 Customers)** Exponentially less common than 2012 companies, but still plentiful. Some customers are willing to engage with me simply to get some ML skills in the room, but therein lies the problem: what they *really* need is white-glove consulting services to just set up their ML problem formulation. This might be a startup trying to scale up ML efforts to improve 3D printing, or build a custom ranking algorithm for their data or to think about how to set up a marketing optimization problem as an MDP. What I want to build is too early for them because they have not much of an ML stack to speak of.
- **(2032 Customers)** The customer is a hard-tech company with strong in-house AI capabilities and ambitious plans to build their own AGI. They clearly understand the value of such a tool, but are hesitant to depend on a third party for such a critical piece of infrastructure. These are the OpenAIs and the DeepMinds and the Self-Driving car companies - rare because they are often not profitable yet and require very patient investor capital to sustain.

The product-market fit problem for hard AI technology is that 2012 customers have already designed and specialized their processes to not require general intelligence. They aren't willing to upend all their process optimizations to take a risk on an unproven technology. From a risk management perspective, it is usually just not worth it; they don't improve competitive advantages by being the first to bet on a new technology, so they are perfectly happy where they are, 10 or more years behind the technology curve.

As you go from 2012, 2022, to 2032 customers, there is an exponentially smaller market opportunity, as often there are only just a handful of companies that are truly comfortable being on the cutting edge of technology.

It's so important when building a startup to focus on what the customer needs and solve their bottlenecks, rather than building what you *want* the customer to need, so I realized that if I wanted to build a "real" business, it would necessitate stepping away from the Extra Hard Tech.

Hard tech companies have a few ways around this dillemma:
- Find partners who are patient, see the future, and are willing to take a risk on you.
- Vertically integrate, so you don't have to convince another company to change up their process, and risk incentive alignment problems and tech risk. The R&D startup can do this by creating their own product, e.g. Amazon Go setting up their own cashierless supermarkets first. Alternatively, the customer company can also do this by incubating a R&D lab, e.g. as Google does with its NLP research teams contributing to the Search and Advertising product.
