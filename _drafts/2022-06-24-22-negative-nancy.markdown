If your have to present 3 bullet points to your boss and you choose 2 good things and 1 bad things, and your boss has 5 direct reports, they hear 10 good things and 5 bad things. They pick 2 good things and 1 bad thing.

The next rung up, again, hear's 10 good things and 5 bad things, presenting 2 good things and 1 bad thing.

and on and on it goes, where a bunch of bad things have been left out of the presentation to the CEO, and they get this rosy, coherent picture of how all the good things fit together.

No! the CEO's job isn't to bask in the glory of their progress, it's to pop the most urgent problem off the queue and fix it.

My previous manager at Google, Kanishka, did this really well - it's what I respected the most about him. Despite him being in the technical weeds and having to be roped into useless meetings all the time with "collaborators" that didn't really make his job easier, he always had an optimistic attitude about collaboration and working together with others. He gave others the benefit of the doubt, even though those people rarely contributed anything of value to his IC (independent contributor) work.
