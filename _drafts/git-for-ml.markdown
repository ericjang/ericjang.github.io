brainstormed an idea with ari:  on 9/26

cheap way to search for model ensembles, which are essentially "distilled Flops" of compute
then combine them together (ensembling, git re-basin, elastic weight averaging) in a way that achieves some good performance
and shortcut a lot of training

then, a bunch of people get together and collectively distill all these models into a new representation that is good.
