Writing a Book like a Podcaster

Twitter personalities and podcasters already do this, why isn't this done?

Why don't authors engage directly with audiences, iteratively updating their content to suit target audiences?

I've written a book!

I've also written some software that trains a language model on the human feedback gathered by people who read the book and left comments. You can think of this as an editor.
