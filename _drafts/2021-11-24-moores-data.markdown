summary: In machine learning, compute and data are interchangeable. Can we evade the end of Moore's law by scaling up data?
---

In machine learning and reinforcement learning in particular, compute and data can be transumted between each other.


One of the implications of the OpenAI grokking paper is that more data can take the place of compute. The toy model can minimize validation error sufficiently on a small dataset, but it needs to train for a long time. If you increase the size of the training data though, it can learn this much faster.
