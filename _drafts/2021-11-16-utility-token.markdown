A simple way to think about the value of a token is that it is a semi-liquid quote of 


buying every token would give you control of the settlement layer, so the value of the set of tokens is roughly equivalent to how much notional value those tokens secure.

For instance, if SOL is used as an L1 settlement layer for moving some bitcoin around, 


One of the things I cannot wrap my head around is how to think about the value of a cryptocurrency tokens, especially ones that participate in securing the consensus mechanism. 
Examples of this include proof-of-stake Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL)


Reflexivity is the notion that causality is not really real in finance



Please read this with an open mind. Many crypto enthusiasts base the foundation of all their reasoning on a cryptocurrency's value going up. 

1. As USD price goes up, so does network security (harder to buy out majority of voting tokens)


2. As USD price goes up, you have fewer transactions
3. As transactions decrease, utility of network decreases
4. 


1. As USD price goes down, you have more transactions
2. As you have more transactions, the utility of the network goes up
3. As utility of network goes up, speculators anticipate future adoption and increase price of token
4. As USD price goes up, you have fewer transactions (unless fees are lowered?)

SOL admits a certain number of transactions per second.


Consider a token like SOL. Suppose it costs 0.01USD per a transaction. 

Solana fees are $0.00025 per transaction
The fees are set by the competition for block-space
which increases when the traffic on the blockchain increases. Compared to Ethereum, Solana has 60 thousand times lower fees
