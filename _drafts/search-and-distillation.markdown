There is a family of methods  (Fast adaptation (non-parametric + meta-learning), MPC with learned state representations, planning, test-time augmentation) that fix some of the “shortcomings” of end-to-end neural network based control. However, eventually the end-to-end methods catch up and outperform the method that used search. Then eventually someone proposes a variation of the prior search ideas, helping to overcome some of the limitations of the better distilled model. Then we distill those, and the cycle begins anew.
