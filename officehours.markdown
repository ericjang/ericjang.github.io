# ML Office Hours, v.2.0

In 2020 I started offering [weekly office hours](https://blog.evjang.com/2020/06/free-office-hours-for-non-traditional.html) to mentor ML researchers from non-traditional backgrounds. I've mentored ~100 people, helped some to get their first ML job offers, and helped a lot of individuals develop research taste to focus on important research questions. 

Since leaving Google, I've since expanded my services to be more broad in scope. Here are some changes: 

- My advising and mentorship services are now open to everyone. It remains free for all students, PhD or not. I reserve the right to decline meetings if I feel that it is not a productive use of my time or if other priorities take hold.
- I am also open to offering general career advice in larger group sessions ("how to get a job in ML"). I'm not sure how to answer this, as it's like being asked "how can I become rich", but it always comes up eventually.
- If you're asking for my advice in a commercial context (i.e. you're working for a startup or plan to use the knowledge gained for your industry job), I will charge a consulting fee, provided that the advising does not present a conflict of interest with my full-time job. I am extremely reluctant to sign NDAs.
- I welcome research engineering questions (e.g. "can you give me some feedback on this research tool I built") in addition to research questions.

If you are interested, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/UZVgmnW3KwXp8YgD7) and I will get in touch. I have also distilled a lot of my research and career advice [into a book](/book).
