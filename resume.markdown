### Goals

My career goal is to build machines that improve exponentially ðŸ“ˆ.

### Work Experience

**2016 - 2022**  Senior Research Scientist at [Robotics at Google](https://research.google/teams/brain/robotics/)

The last decade of Machine Learning research has shown that rich data + simple learning algorithms + powerful computational resources outperforms hand-engineered systems in computer vision, translation, and NLP problems. My research focused on applying that principle to the domain of robotics.

- Co-inventor of the [Gumbel-Softmax / Concrete](https://paperswithcode.com/method/gumbel-softmax) distribution.
- Tech Lead for the Fractal team (20+ FTEs). Trained end-to-end neural networks capable of hundreds of manipulation tasks, including standing bottles upright, pick-and-place for a variety of objects, opening and closing drawers from monocular RGB images.
- Built a shared autonomy system to [open latched doors with neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07600). Featured on [WIRED magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-alphabet-x-robots/)."
- "Several of my publications are featured on the Google AI blog: [Semantic Grasping](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/07/teaching-robots-to-understand-semantic.html), [QT-Opt](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/06/scalable-deep-reinforcement-learning.html), [Grasp2Vec](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/12/grasp2vec-learning-object.html), [RetinaGAN](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/06/toward-generalized-sim-to-real-transfer.html), [BC-Z](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/02/can-robots-follow-instructions-for-new.html).
- Developed [Tensor2Robot](https://github.com/google-research/tensor2robot), a ML framework used by the robotics manipulation team and [Everyday Robots](https://everydayrobots.com/) (until TensorFlow 1 was deprecated).
- First author on 7 papers, coauthored 15+ more. [Select works described here](/projects), and a full list of publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JOYf6ygAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
- Area-chair for ICML, CoRL, and reviewer for many other conferences and workshops.

**2013-2015**: [Various internships]({% post_url 2015-08-17-internship-experiences %}).

### Hobbies

- I write machine learning tutorials and opinions about technology on my [blog](/).

- I enjoy cooking and baking. I am currently trying make a [Tornado Omlette](https://youtu.be/HeB4UgfNDQc?t=177), without much success. 


### Education

- 2012 - 2016 ScM in Computer Science (Concurrent Masters), Brown University
- 2012 - 2016 ScB in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, Brown University
